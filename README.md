# Predictive-Modeling-for-Agriculture
In this project, I developed multi-class classification models to optimize crop selection based on soil health. By analyzing Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, and pH levels, I identified the most critical features for yield. This data-driven approach helps farmers prioritize soil tests, ensuring cost-effective and sustainable outcomes.
